Uptake would be enhanced if it provided, (or was integrated with another program that did) a way to store and search specimen data (label data, GIS, links to iNaturalist), and also to store images captured during examination. 

I will need to dissect my specimens while I use CR, so this would be a very convenient time to take images of the dissected parts, and have them linked to the data matrix. This would help me review and revise my work later. It would also make it easy to build a visual key/glossary. If I can store representative images for a particular character trait and state, it will be easier for me to maintain consistency between sessions. e.g., I could store pictures for typical 'acute' vs 'acuminate' scales, to use to remind myself of my own best practices, or to communicate those standards to other team members.

It would also be useful to have a public repository of character matrices, including images and definitions for the different characters. If the first step in a new study is downloading the 'standard' matrix for your group, it would greatly enhance standardization in the field. Allowing users to upload additional characters would help the system grow. You'd probably want to enable some curation, perhaps by taxon groups. i.e., a Carex team could periodically revise and update their standard matrix, based on input from the community.",3,7,3,3,"The interface was a bit slow and less responsive than something like Excel.

A CR user cannot quickly match closely the colour of the feature with a colour in the chart. This leads to more subjective assessments of colour with many disparate assessments of colour for the same species/specimen. I'm not sure how this deficiency can be rectified.

CR could become an essential step in making taxonomic and especially morphometric work more reproduceable. I think that it would be a very misguided to develop CR as a program tailored solely for Carex taxonomists. I can easily envision it becoming THE program that every plant (or even fungal / animal) taxonomists use to record phenotypic data on specimens.


The next critical steps would be to ensure that the structure of CR allows direct linking of recorded data to physical specimens (via fields for collector, collector number and accession number, etc.), and to allow other users to access data recorded by another user on a specimen. This would ensure that CR remains relevant in the emerging framework of the Extended Specimen.

A next step would be to add fields that enable some terms and definitions be taxon-specific, and to allow different standardized character sets depending on which taxon or which project you are working on. This should be controlled by the user. 

For instance, the term ""utricle (taxon:Cyperaceae)"" would be a deprecated term and an exact synonym of ""perigynium (taxon:Cyperaceae)"", part of the class ""prophyll (taxon:plants)"". 

However, the term ""utricle (taxon:Amaranthaceae)"" would be an accepted term, part of the class ""fruit (taxon:plants)"".

Another critical step would be to ensure that all the options and fields are available to make character definitions as specific and reproduceable as possible. This means adding more fields to specify which particular structure is measured, in what state, how many replicate measurements are needed.",6,"Same as Excel

9",6,"A large part of the negative aspects I noticed during the session was due to badly defined characters chosen as part of the standardized set. I think that a large part of the variation that will be seen across different users during this workshop will come not because of CR per se, but simply because better character definitions should have been chosen from the start.

This is *not* an issue with CR. It is completely fixable and CR seems like a great tool to make character definitions precise and increase consistency and reproducibility of measurements. Adding a few fields to allow character definitions to be more precise will probably be simple. Our main job afterwards will be to come up with character definitions that allow all taxonomically-important variation in Carex to be recorded in a consistent and reproducible manner.","Allow multiple character states per character.

-some people won't want to be 'forced' to score a standard set of characters, despite the valid rationale for doing so in the broader community. This may be particularly true for some later career people who have had their way of working for several decades. Change is hard!
-perceived lack of flexibility in the system or inadequate training
-uneasiness about how other workers may use 'their' data. Needs to be an explicit data sharing model, attribution guidelines, etc., if the aim is for all workers to be able to see everyone else's data. I admit I don't currently understand how this is structured at present. Perhaps complete sharing of the dataset isn't the aim.

I have realized that this tool would be very useful for my own work, even if, for some reason, I chose not to score every character recommended in the core set (some characters at present are confusing, for example). For example, if I were writing descriptions for species in the Arctic, I am not necessarily interested in the entire range of variation within a species. Instead, I am interested in the range of variation in the species in the geographically defined study area (Arctic plants are sometimes smaller than the same taxon in more southerly locations, for example). 

Critical next steps: 
-the community user group should publish a rationale for the core character set that is recommended. It is obvious why many characters have to be included, but not so obvious why some other characters are included. Users need to understand the value of scoring every character across all taxa, including those that they may not have ever scored before. The latter were the ones that challenged me the most. Examples include 'texture' and some of the leaf sheath characters.
-also publish the ontology showing which terms have been combined, removed, etc. (perhaps this is already done?). New users need to understand all the work that has happened to get to the current point.

-improve the definitions of all terms. Where do the definitions come from (references). Include images that show the character state - multiple images from different sources might be a good approach, though much more work to pull together. Present the character state options in different ways - panel of images, list of text (as it is currently), etc. 

-agreement on how the modifiers/constraints should be used. For example, for a structure that is papillose, my sense is many authors would not distinguish between densely papillose vs. moderately papillose, but they may be inclined to indicate 'scarcely'. How important is consistency in this type of situation? This is currently unclear to users. 

-add a notes field for every sample, and perhaps every character scored for every sample. Taxonomists often want to jot down information relevant to a particular measurement. The best place to do this is

-allow users to upload images of each specimen they have measured, and link the specimen to the sample name. I can see this being very useful, for many reasons.




",8,7,"Same as Excel
5",6,"'-see comments in an earlier freeform text box

-lack of clear definitions for all character states so users understand what each terms mean. Another way to do this could be to link to a standard source of terms on the web (not sure if there is a standard, however). 

-lack of definitions for all characters. For example, texture: what are we actually trying to score, tissue structure or pubescence? (I know we have discussed this; I include it just as an example). 

-challenges with clearly describing variation within a particularly character, such as pubescence variation along a long axis. The challenge here may be more with the community agreeing how to approach this than with the software.

-lack of clarity on where exactly to measure a particular character. i.e. which perigynia, which leaf, which inflorescence unit, etc. (this is less a software issue and more an expert-group issue).

-a lot of scrolling required sometimes to see the entire list of character state options. This was sometimes annoying. 

-not sure what to do if a character is absent from a specimen. For example, my specimens did not have anthers, so I could not score them. I left the cells blank. In the future, I may not remember if I simply didn't score those cells for some reason (lack of time) or if the reason was that it was not possible to do so. Ideally, a way to indicate either would be useful. When scoring tens or hundreds of specimens, it's impossible to remember all the details.

"In answer to your question of constraining users’ choice of color terms, my experience with FNA leads me to say, “Yes, constrain them!” There are too many examples of people using terms idiosyncratically, thinking that because they understand what they mean, others will, too. Having color charts for all colors like those you already have for brown, green, and red, and similarly binned, will be essential. Despite my caveats about inconsistent screen rendering and the overly precise (RBG) expression of colors when clearly what you’re representing is a range of colors, I think you’ve taken the right approach. Although some users might initially grumble about being constrained, I think most will quickly value the ease of identifying the proper term and the benefits of greater reproducibility and better communication. I also like that you’ve clearly separated brightness, saturation, and luster from hue, and allowed for different forms of multi-coloration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I also liked the implementation of multiple entry of states for qualitative characters and the rendering of the descriptions with “or”, “sometimes”, and “rarely.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I think there’s a similar need to find a way to allow multiple entry for quantitative data. For example, leaf length and width usually vary on a single specimen and being able to record more than one value would be helpful. I realize one could do that by treating each leaf as a sample, but that would distort the outcome. One could also enter the manually calculated mean or median value for a specimen, but that would lead to loss of data. Of course, if one also wants to calculate ratios, it would be necessary to associate each length with the proper width. Bottom line: this might be complicated, but I think it is important to explore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Related to that, I’d love to see a way to include an identifier with each sample. I’d suggest collector, collector number, and herbarium to identify each sample. This works well with what is already standard practice for monographic and revisionary work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It’s not clear to me with the Carex dataset how surface texture and relief are differentiated. Some of the surface texture terms, for example rough and roughened, are relief as I think of it. Frankly, I’m not sure what surface texture means! I think of texture in the context of the terms listed under internal texture. But perhaps the Carex people think of these differently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having a way to import existing data (from a spreadsheet or its csv equivalent) would facilitate future adoption because people could more easily build on work they’ve already done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
